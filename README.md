The project solves the problem of finding a reliable game companion, lack of a secure payment system, value communication and lack of community space. The platform connects players with creators, providing transparent payments and next-generation tools.

### Folder Structure

The project contains two main folders:

**fe-GameConnect**

 - Contains the source code for the user interface.
 - Built using Vite, TypeScript, and styled with TailwindCSS.
 - Responsible for displaying the interface and interacting with the backend via API.
   
**server**

 - Contains the server-side source code.
 - Developed using Node.js.
 - Provides APIs for the frontend and manages the database.

## Requirements
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Yarn** (optional): Yarn is an alternative to npm that helps manage dependencies. If you prefer using Yarn, you can install it from [from yarnpkg.com.](https://yarnpkg.com/).
- Bun (optional): Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime like Node.js, but with a focus on speed. If you prefer to use Bun, you can install it from [bun.sh]([https://bun.sh/]).
- pnpm (optional): PNPM is an efficient alternative to npm and Yarn. To install PNPM, you can download it from [pnpm.io]([https://pnpm.io/])
